# Signal Protocol Example

This is a repository that contains client and server implementations of the [Signal Protocol](https://signal.org/docs/).
Because there are no useful and working examples online that I could find.

### Directories 
`basic` directory contains a basic example that is sufficient enough to establish an encrypted session between two devices.
